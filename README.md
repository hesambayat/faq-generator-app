## Development workflow
After cloning the project, run `yarn` to fetch its dependencies. Then, you can run the following commands:

- `yarn start` compiles and hot-reloads for development.
- `yarn build` compiles and minifies for production.
- `yarn test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `yarn eject` removes the single build dependency from your project. **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Styles guide
This app follows BEM methodology. \
See [BEM introduction](http://getbem.com/introduction/).

## Tests
The test suites are categorized into two test types, integration, and functional tests. 
- Integration tests are suffixed by `.test.js` and usually located in the `__tests__` folders.
- Functional tests are suffixed by `.spec.js` and usually located in the app root directory `/tests`

### Integration testing
Integration tests are isolated and individual tests for components, stores,  utils, etc., to ensure they work as expected. They do not tend to cover business logic and requirements.  

### Functional testing
Functional tests verify the app functionality and business requirements as a whole. They also demonstrate that various user flows work as expected and can be as simple as loading a page or more complex scenarios.
